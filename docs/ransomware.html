      <h2>Ransomwares</h2>
      <p>Ransomware represents a malicious software category that encrypts files or entire systems, rendering them inaccessible to users. Perpetrators demand ransom payments, often in cryptocurrency, in exchange for decryption keys or device unlock codes.</p>
      <p>These attacks can have devastating consequences for individuals and businesses, causing financial losses, operational disruptions, and reputation damage.</p>
