      <h2>Trojans</h2>
      <p>Trojans are deceptive malware that disguise themselves as legitimate software, tricking users into installing them. Once installed, they can perform various malicious actions, such as stealing sensitive information, damaging files, or providing unauthorized access to the system.</p>
      <p>Unlike viruses or worms, Trojans do not replicate themselves but rely on social engineering tactics to spread.</p>
