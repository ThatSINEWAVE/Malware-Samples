      <h1>About XWorm</h1>
      <p>XWorm is a malicious computer worm designed to spread rapidly across networks and infect a large number of devices. It poses a significant threat to network security by exploiting vulnerabilities in operating systems and software applications.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>How it works?</h2>
      <p>XWorm spreads through network connections, taking advantage of vulnerabilities in target systems to gain unauthorized access. Once inside a network, it seeks out vulnerable devices and uses various propagation techniques, such as exploiting unpatched software, weak passwords, or misconfigured network settings, to infect them.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, XWorm may include self-replication mechanisms, allowing it to create copies of itself and distribute them to other devices within the network, thereby facilitating its rapid spread.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>What is the target?</h2>
      <p>The primary target of XWorm is networks comprised of interconnected devices, including but not limited to computers, servers, routers, and IoT (Internet of Things) devices. Its indiscriminate nature makes it a significant threat to both individual users and organizations, including businesses, government agencies, and educational institutions.</p>
      <p>XWorm's ability to compromise network security and disrupt operations makes it particularly appealing to cybercriminals seeking to steal data, launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, or engage in other malicious activities.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>Who created it?</h2>
      <p>The identity of XWorm's creators remains unknown, as is often the case with malware authors who operate anonymously or under pseudonyms. XWorm may have been developed by individual hackers, cybercriminal groups, or state-sponsored actors seeking to exploit vulnerabilities in computer networks for their own malicious purposes.</p>
      <p>As XWorm continues to pose a threat to network security, efforts are underway by cybersecurity researchers and network administrators to detect and mitigate its spread, as well as to implement proactive measures to protect against future attacks.</p>
