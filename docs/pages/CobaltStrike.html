      <h1>About CobaltStrike</h1>
      <p>CobaltStrike is a powerful and sophisticated penetration testing tool commonly used by cybersecurity professionals for red teaming exercises and adversary simulation. However, it has also been weaponized by malicious actors and used for nefarious purposes, making it a significant threat in the cybersecurity landscape.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>How it works?</h2>
      <p>CobaltStrike provides a comprehensive set of capabilities for simulating advanced cyberattacks, including command and control (C2) communication, payload delivery, privilege escalation, lateral movement, and post-exploitation activities. It allows users to emulate real-world threat actor tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to assess and improve an organization's security posture.</p>
      <p>Malicious actors often leverage CobaltStrike to conduct targeted attacks against organizations, exploiting vulnerabilities, and evading detection by security measures. The tool's modular architecture and extensive feature set make it a favored choice among both cybercriminals and advanced persistent threat (APT) groups.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>What is the target?</h2>
      <p>CobaltStrike can be used to target a wide range of organizations across various industries, including government agencies, financial institutions, healthcare providers, and technology companies. Its flexibility and adaptability allow threat actors to tailor their attacks to specific targets and objectives.</p>
      <p>The tool is particularly effective in penetrating network defenses, escalating privileges, and exfiltrating sensitive data, making it a valuable asset for cyber espionage, data theft, and ransomware campaigns. Organizations with insufficient security controls and weak defenses are especially vulnerable to attacks leveraging CobaltStrike.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>Who created it?</h2>
      <p>CobaltStrike was created by Raphael Mudge as a legitimate penetration testing tool for cybersecurity professionals. However, its popularity and extensive feature set have also attracted the attention of malicious actors, who have repurposed it for malicious activities.</p>
      <p>The tool is distributed commercially by Strategic Cyber LLC, allowing legitimate users to purchase licenses for conducting authorized red teaming exercises and security assessments. However, unauthorized use of CobaltStrike by cybercriminals and APT groups poses a significant threat to organizations worldwide.</p>
