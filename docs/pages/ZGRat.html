      <h1>About ZGRat</h1>
      <p>ZGRat is a malicious Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that enables attackers to gain unauthorized access and control over infected systems. It poses a significant threat to the security and privacy of individuals and organizations by providing attackers with the ability to execute commands remotely, steal sensitive information, and perform malicious activities.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>How it works?</h2>
      <p>ZGRat typically infiltrates systems through various vectors, including phishing emails, malicious downloads, or exploiting software vulnerabilities. Once installed on a target system, it establishes a covert connection with a remote command and control (C&C) server, allowing attackers to control the compromised system remotely.</p>
      <p>ZGRat may include features such as keylogging, screen capturing, file manipulation, and webcam or microphone spying, enabling attackers to gather sensitive information, steal credentials, and monitor user activities surreptitiously.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>What is the target?</h2>
      <p>The primary target of ZGRat is both individual users and organizations across various sectors, including but not limited to businesses, government agencies, financial institutions, and educational institutions. Its capabilities make it appealing to cybercriminals engaged in espionage, data theft, financial fraud, and other malicious activities.</p>
      <p>Moreover, ZGRat may be deployed in targeted attacks against specific individuals or organizations for intelligence gathering, sabotage, or extortion.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>Who created it?</h2>
      <p>The exact creators of ZGRat remain unknown, as is often the case with malware authors who operate anonymously or under pseudonyms. ZGRat may have been developed by individual hackers, cybercriminal groups, or state-sponsored actors seeking to exploit vulnerabilities in computer systems for their own malicious purposes.</p>
      <p>As ZGRat continues to pose a threat to cybersecurity, efforts are underway by security researchers and law enforcement agencies to analyze its behavior, develop detection methods, and mitigate its impact on affected systems.</p>
