      <h1>About MASSLogger</h1>
      <p>MASSLogger is a sophisticated information-stealing malware designed to infiltrate systems, capture sensitive information, and exfiltrate it to remote servers controlled by cybercriminals. It poses a significant threat to individuals and organizations by compromising their data privacy and security.</p>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>How it works?</h2>
      <p>MASSLogger typically spreads through phishing emails containing malicious attachments or links. When a victim interacts with the malicious content, MASSLogger infiltrates the system and installs itself stealthily, often evading detection by security software.</p>
      <p>Once installed, MASSLogger collects sensitive information from the infected system, including keystrokes, clipboard data, browser history, and stored credentials. It may also capture screenshots and record audio or video from the victim's device, allowing attackers to gather extensive intelligence.</p>
