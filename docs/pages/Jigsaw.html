        <h1>About Jigsaw</h1>
        <p>Jigsaw is a type of ransomware that earned its name due to its association with the fictional character from the horror movie franchise "Saw." It is notorious for its ruthless tactics, which involve encrypting victims' files and demanding ransom payments for their decryption.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>How it works?</h2>
        <p>Jigsaw typically infects systems through phishing emails, malicious attachments, or exploit kits. Once executed on a victim's computer, it encrypts files using strong encryption algorithms, rendering them inaccessible. In addition to file encryption, Jigsaw exhibits a unique behavior of deleting files incrementally until the ransom is paid.</p>
        <p>As part of its intimidation tactics, Jigsaw displays a countdown timer, threatening to delete more files if the ransom is not paid within a specified timeframe. It may also display frightening messages and images, creating a sense of urgency and fear to coerce victims into paying the ransom.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>What is the target?</h2>
        <p>Jigsaw targets individuals and organizations indiscriminately, with a primary focus on Windows-based systems. Its victims range from individual users to small businesses, large corporations, and even government agencies.</p>
        <p>Any system that falls victim to Jigsaw can suffer severe consequences, including data loss, financial damage, and operational disruptions. Jigsaw's indiscriminate targeting and destructive capabilities make it a significant threat to the cybersecurity landscape.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>Who created it?</h2>
        <p>The specific individuals or groups behind Jigsaw remain unknown, as they typically operate under pseudonyms or aliases to conceal their identities. Jigsaw may have originated from underground cybercriminal communities or individual hackers seeking financial gain.</p>
        <p>Ransomware, including Jigsaw, is often distributed through underground forums, dark web marketplaces, or ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) platforms, where cybercriminals can purchase or rent the malware to carry out their attacks. The creators of Jigsaw likely have motives rooted in financial gain, exploiting victims' desperation to recover their encrypted files.</p>
