        <h1>About QakBot</h1>

      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>How it works?</h2>
        <p>QakBot typically infects systems through phishing emails or malicious downloads. Once it infiltrates a system, it establishes persistence by modifying system settings and registry entries.</p>
        <p>It then employs various techniques to evade detection, such as polymorphic code and encryption. QakBot also has the ability to self-propagate within a network, making it particularly dangerous in corporate environments.</p>
