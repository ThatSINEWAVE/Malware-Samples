        <h1>About Djvu</h1>
        <p>Djvu is a family of file-encrypting ransomware that has been active for several years, causing significant damage to individuals and organizations worldwide. Known for its widespread distribution and complex encryption methods, Djvu poses a serious threat to data security and integrity.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>How it works?</h2>
        <p>Djvu typically infects systems through various vectors, including malicious email attachments, software cracks, fake updates, and compromised websites. Once executed on a victim's system, the ransomware begins encrypting files using strong encryption algorithms, rendering them inaccessible without the decryption key.</p>
        <p>After encrypting the files, Djvu displays a ransom note on the victim's screen, demanding payment in cryptocurrency, usually Bitcoin, in exchange for the decryption key. The ransom amount and payment instructions may vary, but victims are often given a deadline to pay, after which the ransom amount may increase or files may be permanently deleted.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>What is the target?</h2>
        <p>Djvu targets individuals, businesses, and organizations across various sectors, indiscriminately encrypting files on infected systems. While no specific industry or entity is immune to Djvu attacks, it has been particularly prevalent in sectors such as healthcare, education, finance, and government.</p>
        <p>The ransomware aims to extort money from victims by encrypting valuable data and demanding payment for its release. This includes sensitive information such as personal documents, financial records, intellectual property, and other critical files.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>Who created it?</h2>
        <p>The creators of Djvu remain largely unknown, as they operate anonymously in underground forums and dark web marketplaces. Djvu is believed to be the work of a sophisticated cybercriminal group or possibly a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation, where the ransomware is offered for sale or rent to other cybercriminals.</p>
        <p>Despite various mitigation efforts by cybersecurity researchers and law enforcement agencies, Djvu variants continue to evolve and adapt, posing a persistent threat to individuals and organizations worldwide. Defending against Djvu and similar ransomware requires a proactive and multi-layered approach to cybersecurity, including regular data backups, endpoint protection, network segmentation, user education, and incident response planning.</p>
