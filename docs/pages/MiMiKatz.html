        <h1>About MiMiKatz</h1>
        <p>MiMiKatz is a powerful post-exploitation tool used to extract plaintext passwords, hashes, and other credentials from Windows operating systems' memory. It is commonly utilized by both penetration testers and malicious actors to escalate privileges, move laterally across networks, and perform credential theft.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>How it works?</h2>
        <p>MiMiKatz takes advantage of vulnerabilities in Windows security mechanisms to retrieve sensitive information stored in the operating system's memory. It can extract credentials from various sources, including the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process, which stores user authentication data.</p>
        <p>Once executed on a compromised system, MiMiKatz injects itself into the LSASS process's memory space, allowing it to interact directly with authentication data. It then performs operations such as dumping credentials, recovering plaintext passwords, or generating Kerberos tickets, all without leaving traces on disk.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>What is the target?</h2>
        <p>The primary targets of MiMiKatz are Windows-based systems within corporate networks, government agencies, and other organizations. It can be used to target individual computers, servers, and domain controllers, enabling attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information and critical resources.</p>
        <p>MiMiKatz's ability to extract plaintext passwords and hashes poses a significant risk to organizations' security, as it can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and compromise of sensitive assets. Any system running a vulnerable version of Windows is potentially at risk from MiMiKatz attacks.</p>

      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>Who created it?</h2>
        <p>MiMiKatz was developed by Benjamin Delpy, a French security researcher, in 2011 as a proof-of-concept tool to demonstrate weaknesses in Windows security mechanisms. Since then, it has gained widespread popularity among security professionals and attackers alike due to its effectiveness in extracting credentials and escalating privileges.</p>
        <p>While MiMiKatz was originally created for legitimate security research purposes, it has also been weaponized by cybercriminals for malicious activities such as credential theft, lateral movement, and privilege escalation in cyber attacks.</p>
