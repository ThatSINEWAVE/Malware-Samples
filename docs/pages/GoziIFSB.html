      <h1>About GoziIFSB</h1>
      <p>GoziIFSB, also known as Gozi-ISFB, is a highly sophisticated banking Trojan that represents an evolution of the original Gozi malware. It is designed to target financial institutions and their customers, with a focus on stealing sensitive banking information for financial gain.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>How it works?</h2>
      <p>GoziIFSB employs various tactics to infect and compromise systems, including phishing emails, exploit kits, and malicious downloads. Once installed on a victim's computer, it operates silently in the background, intercepting and recording sensitive information entered on banking websites and other online platforms.</p>
      <p>One of GoziIFSB's notable features is its advanced evasion techniques, which allow it to evade detection by antivirus software and security mechanisms. It achieves this through polymorphic code, encryption, and obfuscation, making it challenging for security researchers to analyze and detect.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>What is the target?</h2>
      <p>GoziIFSB primarily targets financial institutions, including banks, credit unions, and online payment platforms, as well as their customers. By compromising the accounts of individuals and businesses, it enables cybercriminals to carry out various fraudulent activities, including unauthorized fund transfers, identity theft, and credit card fraud.</p>
      <p>Additionally, GoziIFSB may target users of other online services, such as e-commerce websites and social media platforms, where financial transactions or personal information are involved. Its impact can be devastating for both individuals and organizations, leading to financial losses and reputational damage.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>Who created it?</h2>
      <p>The specific individuals or groups behind GoziIFSB remain unknown, as they operate anonymously within underground cybercriminal communities. It is believed that GoziIFSB is developed and maintained by skilled hackers with advanced knowledge of malware development and cybersecurity.</p>
      <p>GoziIFSB may be distributed through various underground channels, including dark web forums, private cybercrime communities, and underground marketplaces. Its creators may have financial motives, seeking to profit from the sale of stolen financial data or by offering GoziIFSB as a service to other cybercriminals.</p>
