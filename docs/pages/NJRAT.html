        <h1>About NJRAT</h1>
        <p>NJRAT (also known as Nanocore or Nano Core RAT) is a remote access trojan designed to provide unauthorized access and control over infected systems. It is a popular malware tool used by cybercriminals to steal sensitive data, monitor user activities, and execute malicious commands remotely.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>How it works?</h2>
        <p>NJRAT typically spreads through malicious email attachments, exploit kits, or drive-by downloads. Once executed on the target system, it establishes a connection with a command-and-control (C2) server controlled by the attacker.</p>
        <p>Once connected, NJRAT enables the attacker to perform various malicious activities, such as keylogging, screen capture, file transfer, process manipulation, and remote code execution. It employs various techniques to evade detection and maintain persistence on the infected system.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>What is the target?</h2>
        <p>NJRAT is primarily used to target individuals, businesses, and organizations with valuable data or systems. It can infect a wide range of Windows operating systems, making it a versatile tool for cybercriminals.</p>
        <p>NJRAT is often used in targeted attacks against specific entities, such as corporations, financial institutions, government agencies, and critical infrastructure sectors. Its capabilities make it an attractive tool for cybercriminals seeking to steal sensitive information, conduct espionage, or gain unauthorized access to networks and systems.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>Who created it?</h2>
        <p>The original creator of NJRAT is unknown, as it has been widely distributed on underground cybercrime forums and markets. It is believed to have been developed by individual hackers or cybercrime groups seeking to profit from illicit activities.</p>
        <p>Over time, NJRAT has been modified and updated by various actors within the cybercriminal ecosystem, leading to the emergence of multiple variants and versions with enhanced capabilities. Its widespread availability on underground markets contributes to its prevalence in cyber attacks.</p>
