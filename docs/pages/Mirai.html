      <h1>About Mirai</h1>
      <p>Mirai is a notorious malware strain known for its ability to infect and control Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as routers, IP cameras, and DVRs, to form a botnet. It gained widespread attention in 2016 after launching massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against prominent internet services and websites.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>How it works?</h2>
      <p>Mirai works by scanning the internet for vulnerable IoT devices with default or weak credentials. Once it identifies a susceptible device, Mirai attempts to brute-force login credentials or exploit known security vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access.</p>
      <p>After infecting a device, Mirai establishes communication with a command-and-control (C2) server operated by the malware's creators. The infected device becomes part of a botnet, which the attackers can remotely control to launch large-scale DDoS attacks, mine cryptocurrencies, or carry out other malicious activities.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>What is the target?</h2>
      <p>The primary targets of Mirai are poorly secured IoT devices connected to the internet. These devices include routers, IP cameras, DVRs, smart thermostats, and other internet-connected appliances commonly found in homes, businesses, and industrial environments.</p>
      <p>Mirai exploits vulnerabilities in the firmware and software of these devices, leveraging them to build a botnet capable of launching powerful DDoS attacks. By targeting IoT devices, Mirai poses a significant threat to the stability and security of internet infrastructure and services.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>Who created it?</h2>
      <p>Mirai was created by a hacker or group of hackers using the pseudonym "Anna-senpai." The true identity of the individual or group behind Mirai remains unknown. Mirai's source code was released publicly in September 2016, leading to the proliferation of variants and copycat malware.</p>
      <p>The release of Mirai's source code enabled other cybercriminals to create their own botnets based on the Mirai framework, contributing to the widespread proliferation of IoT botnets and DDoS attacks. Mirai's impact on internet security highlighted the importance of securing IoT devices and prompted efforts to improve IoT security standards.</p>
