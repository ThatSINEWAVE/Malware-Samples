      <h1>About Petya</h1>
      <p>Petya is a notorious ransomware strain that gained widespread attention for its destructive capabilities and high-profile attacks targeting organizations worldwide. First identified in 2016, Petya has evolved over time, with variants such as NotPetya and GoldenEye causing significant disruption and financial losses.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>How it works?</h2>
      <p>Petya typically spreads via phishing emails containing malicious attachments or links, which, when clicked, initiate the ransomware infection process. Once inside a system, Petya encrypts files using advanced cryptographic algorithms, rendering them inaccessible to users.</p>
      <p>In addition to file encryption, Petya is known for its destructive capabilities, as it also targets the master boot record (MBR) or master file table (MFT) of infected systems. This aggressive behavior makes affected systems unbootable, effectively paralyzing entire networks and causing widespread disruption.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>What is the target?</h2>
      <p>Petya primarily targets businesses and organizations across various sectors, including finance, healthcare, manufacturing, and government agencies. Its sophisticated encryption techniques and destructive nature make it particularly harmful, leading to data loss, operational downtime, and financial harm for affected entities.</p>
      <p>During large-scale outbreaks, Petya has demonstrated its ability to spread rapidly across networks, affecting organizations globally and emphasizing the importance of robust cybersecurity measures to prevent and mitigate its impact.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>Who created it?</h2>
      <p>The exact identity of the individuals or groups behind Petya remains uncertain. While some attributions and theories have been proposed by cybersecurity researchers and experts, definitive attribution is challenging due to the anonymity and clandestine nature of cyberattacks.</p>
      <p>Speculation suggests the involvement of sophisticated cybercriminal organizations or state-sponsored threat actors with diverse motives, including financial gain, geopolitical disruption, or espionage. However, conclusive evidence linking specific actors to the creation and distribution of Petya is lacking.</p>
