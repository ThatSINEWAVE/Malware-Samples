        <h1>About XMRig</h1>
        <p>XMRig is a popular open-source cryptocurrency mining software designed to mine Monero (XMR) cryptocurrency. While XMRig itself is not inherently malicious, it has been widely abused by cybercriminals to secretly mine Monero on compromised systems without the owner's consent.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>How it works?</h2>
        <p>XMRig operates by utilizing the processing power of infected systems to perform complex mathematical calculations required for cryptocurrency mining. It typically spreads through various vectors, including phishing emails, malicious downloads, or exploiting software vulnerabilities.</p>
        <p>Once installed on a system, XMRig runs silently in the background, consuming CPU and GPU resources to mine Monero. The generated cryptocurrency is then sent to the attacker's wallet, providing them with a source of illicit income.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>What is the target?</h2>
        <p>The primary target of XMRig is the processing power of computer systems, regardless of the operating system or hardware configuration. Cybercriminals deploy XMRig on a wide range of devices, including personal computers, servers, and even mobile devices, to mine Monero cryptocurrency surreptitiously.</p>
        <p>Moreover, XMRig may also target vulnerable web servers, exploiting them to mine Monero using visitors' computing resources without their knowledge.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>Who created it?</h2>
        <p>XMRig was originally developed as an open-source project by a group of software developers interested in cryptocurrency mining. However, its widespread adoption by cybercriminals has led to its association with various malicious activities, including cryptojacking and unauthorized cryptocurrency mining.</p>
        <p>As XMRig continues to be abused by threat actors for illicit gain, efforts are underway by cybersecurity researchers and law enforcement agencies to detect and mitigate its impact on affected systems.</p>
