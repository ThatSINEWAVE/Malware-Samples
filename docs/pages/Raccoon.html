      <h1>About Raccoon</h1>
      <p>Raccoon, also known as "Mohazo" or "Racealer," is a sophisticated information-stealing malware designed to harvest sensitive data from infected systems. It primarily targets Windows-based machines and has been actively used by cybercriminals since at least 2019.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>How it works?</h2>
      <p>Raccoon typically spreads through malicious email attachments, compromised websites, or exploit kits. Once executed on a victim's system, it quietly runs in the background, collecting sensitive information such as login credentials, financial data, and personal information.</p>
      <p>Raccoon employs various techniques to evade detection, including anti-analysis mechanisms and encryption. It can also self-update to ensure its persistence and adaptability against security measures.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>What is the target?</h2>
      <p>Raccoon targets individuals and organizations across various sectors, with a primary focus on stealing sensitive information for financial gain. Its victims often include financial institutions, retail businesses, healthcare providers, and educational institutions.</p>
      <p>Additionally, Raccoon has been observed targeting individuals through phishing campaigns, exploiting their personal information for identity theft and other fraudulent activities.</p>

      <h2>Who created it?</h2>
      <p>The creators of Raccoon remain largely unidentified, operating in the shadows of the cybercriminal underground. It is believed that Raccoon is distributed through underground forums and sold as a service to other cybercriminals.</p>
      <p>Its modular design and regular updates suggest a sophisticated development team behind it, likely driven by financial motives. Raccoon continues to pose a significant threat to cybersecurity, requiring constant vigilance and proactive defense measures to mitigate its impact.</p>
