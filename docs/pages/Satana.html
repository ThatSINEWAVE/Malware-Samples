      <h1>About Satana</h1>
      <p>Satana is a malicious ransomware variant known for its destructive capabilities and extortion tactics. It encrypts files on infected systems and demands a ransom payment from victims in exchange for the decryption key, threatening to permanently delete files if payment is not made.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>How it works?</h2>
      <p>Satana typically spreads through phishing emails, malicious downloads, or exploit kits. Once it infects a system, it encrypts files using strong encryption algorithms, rendering them inaccessible to the user. It then displays a ransom note, providing instructions on how to pay the ransom and receive the decryption key.</p>
      <p>Satana may also employ additional tactics, such as deleting shadow copies and backup files to prevent victims from recovering their data without paying the ransom.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>What is the target?</h2>
      <p>Satana targets individuals, businesses, and organizations across various sectors. Its victims include individuals who may have valuable personal files, as well as businesses and institutions that rely on digital data for their operations.</p>
      <p>While Satana may cast a wide net in its distribution, it has been particularly detrimental to small and medium-sized businesses that may lack robust cybersecurity measures to prevent and mitigate ransomware attacks.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>Who created it?</h2>
      <p>The identity of the creators of Satana remains unknown, as ransomware developers often operate under pseudonyms or remain anonymous to avoid legal repercussions. Satana may have been developed by individual cybercriminals or organized hacker groups seeking financial gain through extortion.</p>
      <p>Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) models also allow aspiring cybercriminals to rent or purchase ransomware variants like Satana, further obscuring the true identity of the creators.</p>
