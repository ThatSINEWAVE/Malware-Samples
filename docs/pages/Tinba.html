      <h1>About Tinba</h1>
      <p>Tinba, also known as Tiny Banker or Zusy, is a notorious banking Trojan designed to steal sensitive financial information from victims. It is one of the smallest and most sophisticated banking malware strains, capable of evading detection by security software and carrying out stealthy attacks on banking systems and users.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>How it works?</h2>
      <p>Tinba typically infects systems through various vectors, including phishing emails, malicious downloads, or exploiting software vulnerabilities. Once it gains access to a system, it installs itself and starts monitoring the victim's online banking activities.</p>
      <p>When a victim visits a banking website, Tinba injects malicious code into the webpage, creating a fake login form that captures the user's credentials, such as usernames and passwords. It then sends this information to a remote command and control (C&C) server controlled by cybercriminals.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>What is the target?</h2>
      <p>Tinba primarily targets users of online banking services, financial institutions, and payment processing systems. Its main objective is to steal sensitive financial information, including login credentials, account numbers, and credit card details, which can be used for fraudulent transactions and identity theft.</p>
      <p>Tinba's targets include individuals, businesses, and organizations across various sectors and geographic regions. It poses a significant threat to the security of online financial transactions, leading to financial loss, reputational damage, and regulatory penalties.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>Who created it?</h2>
      <p>The creators of Tinba remain largely unidentified, as malware developers often operate anonymously to avoid detection and legal repercussions. Tinba may have been developed by individual hackers, cybercriminal groups, or sophisticated criminal organizations specializing in financial fraud.</p>
      <p>Regardless of its origins, Tinba underscores the ongoing threat posed by banking Trojans to individuals and organizations worldwide, highlighting the importance of implementing robust cybersecurity measures and educating users about safe online banking practices to mitigate the risks.</p>
