        <h1>About Happy99</h1>
        <p>Happy99, also known as Ska, is a type of malware that spreads via email attachments and infects Windows systems.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>How it works?</h2>
        <p>Happy99 typically arrives as an email attachment or a file downloaded from the internet. When executed, it displays a fireworks animation to distract the user while it secretly installs itself in the background.</p>
        <p>Once installed, Happy99 modifies the user's email settings to send copies of itself to everyone listed in the user's email address book, thereby propagating itself further.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>What is the target?</h2>
        <p>Happy99 primarily targets Windows users, exploiting vulnerabilities in the operating system to infect and spread to other systems. Its objective is not necessarily to cause direct harm but rather to propagate itself and potentially disrupt email communications.</p>
        <p>However, Happy99 infections can still lead to system slowdowns, email disruptions, and compromised security if left unchecked.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>Who created it?</h2>
        <p>The creator or creators of Happy99 remain unknown, but it is believed to have originated from amateur programmers or individuals with a mischievous intent rather than sophisticated cybercriminals.</p>
        <p>Happy99 serves as a reminder of the importance of exercising caution when handling email attachments and maintaining up-to-date antivirus software to prevent the spread of malware.</p>
