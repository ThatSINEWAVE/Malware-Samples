        <h1>About Magistr</h1>
        <p>Magistr is a polymorphic computer virus that spreads through email attachments and network shares, posing a significant threat to computer systems.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>How it works?</h2>
        <p>Magistr typically arrives in the form of an email attachment with a tempting subject line and file name. When the attachment is opened, Magistr infects the host system and may modify or delete files, overwrite hard drives, and spread to other connected systems.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, Magistr is polymorphic, meaning it can change its code slightly with each infection, making it challenging for antivirus software to detect and remove.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>What is the target?</h2>
        <p>Magistr targets Windows-based systems, including personal computers and network servers. Its primary goal is to spread rapidly across networks, causing data loss, system instability, and potential damage to critical files and applications.</p>
        <p>Organizations and individuals alike are at risk of Magistr infections, emphasizing the importance of proactive cybersecurity measures and user awareness to prevent the spread of this destructive virus.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>Who created it?</h2>
        <p>The identity of the individual or group responsible for creating Magistr remains unknown. Like many malware strains, Magistr is believed to have originated from skilled cybercriminals or hacker groups seeking to exploit vulnerabilities in computer systems for financial gain or malicious intent.</p>
        <p>Magistr serves as a reminder of the ongoing threat posed by computer viruses and the critical need for robust cybersecurity practices to protect against such malicious software.</p>
