      <h1>About Lumma</h1>
      <p>Lumma is a relatively new strain of malware that has emerged as a significant threat in the cybersecurity landscape. It is known for its stealthy behavior and advanced evasion techniques, making it challenging to detect and mitigate.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>How it works?</h2>
      <p>Lumma employs various infiltration methods, including phishing emails, malicious attachments, or drive-by downloads. Once inside a system, it establishes persistence and conceals its presence to avoid detection by security software.</p>
      <p>One of Lumma's distinguishing features is its ability to evade traditional detection methods, such as signature-based antivirus software, by constantly mutating and encrypting its code. This polymorphic behavior allows Lumma to bypass security measures and infect systems undetected.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>What is the target?</h2>
      <p>Lumma targets a wide range of users and organizations, including individual users, businesses, government agencies, and educational institutions. Its primary objective is often financial gain, achieved through various means such as data theft, extortion, or unauthorized access to financial accounts.</p>
      <p>Moreover, Lumma may also target individuals for personal gain, such as stealing login credentials for online accounts, email accounts, and social media accounts. Its impact can be significant, leading to financial losses, reputational damage, and legal liabilities for victims.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>Who created it?</h2>
      <p>The specific individuals or groups behind Lumma remain largely unknown, as they typically operate under pseudonyms or aliases to conceal their identities. Lumma may have originated from underground cybercriminal communities or individual hackers seeking to profit from stolen information.</p>
      <p>Lumma is often distributed through underground channels, including forums, websites, and messaging platforms, where cybercriminals exchange malicious code or sell access to compromised systems. The creators of Lumma likely have motives rooted in financial gain, exploiting unsuspecting users for illicit profits.</p>
