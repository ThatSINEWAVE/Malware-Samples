        <h1>About Neshta</h1>
        <p>Neshta is a computer virus that primarily targets Windows operating systems. It belongs to the category of file infectors, meaning it infects executable files on the infected system, thereby compromising their functionality and potentially spreading to other files and systems.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>How it works?</h2>
        <p>Neshta infects executable files by appending its malicious code to them, thereby altering their original functionality. When an infected file is executed, Neshta's code is triggered, allowing it to gain control over the infected system and perform various malicious activities.</p>
        <p>One of Neshta's notable characteristics is its ability to spread via removable media such as USB drives. When an infected file is copied to a USB drive and then executed on another computer, the virus can spread to that system, further propagating its infection.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>What is the target?</h2>
        <p>The primary targets of Neshta are Windows users and systems. It can infect a wide range of executable files, including those associated with system processes, applications, and utilities. Neshta's ability to spread via removable media makes it particularly dangerous in environments where USB drives are commonly used.</p>
        <p>While Neshta's impact may vary depending on its specific variant and the security measures in place, it poses a significant threat to the integrity and security of infected systems, potentially leading to data loss, system instability, and unauthorized access.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>Who created it?</h2>
        <p>The identity of the original creator of Neshta is unknown, as is often the case with malware authors who operate anonymously or under pseudonyms. Neshta may have been developed by individual hackers, cybercriminal groups, or state-sponsored actors with various motives.</p>
        <p>Like many other malware strains, Neshta's source code may have been shared or sold on underground forums, leading to the emergence of multiple variants and versions created by different actors within the cybercriminal ecosystem.</p>
