      <h1>About Emotet</h1>
      <p>Emotet is a sophisticated and prolific malware strain that has been active since around 2014. Initially designed as a banking trojan, Emotet has evolved into a modular malware platform capable of delivering various payloads, including ransomware and other malware families. It has become one of the most significant threats to cybersecurity globally.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>How it works?</h2>
      <p>Emotet typically spreads via malicious email attachments, such as Word documents or PDFs containing embedded macros. When a user opens the infected attachment and enables macros, Emotet executes its payload, infecting the system and establishing a foothold for further malicious activities.</p>
      <p>Once installed on a system, Emotet acts as a downloader, retrieving and executing additional malware payloads from command and control (C2) servers controlled by the attackers. These payloads may include ransomware, banking trojans, information stealers, or other malware designed to achieve specific malicious objectives.</p>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>What is the target?</h2>
      <p>Emotet targets individuals, businesses, and organizations across various sectors, with a primary focus on entities with valuable data or resources. It has been observed targeting users in industries such as finance, healthcare, government, and manufacturing.</p>
      <p>The malware aims to steal sensitive information, such as login credentials, financial data, and personal information, for various malicious purposes, including financial fraud, identity theft, and espionage. Emotet's modular nature allows it to adapt to different environments and deliver tailored payloads based on the attackers' objectives.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>Who created it?</h2>
      <p>The specific individuals or groups behind Emotet remain largely unknown. Emotet is believed to have originated from Eastern Europe and is associated with a sophisticated cybercriminal operation. The malware is often distributed via a botnet infrastructure, with infected machines acting as distribution points for spreading Emotet further.</p>
      <p>Despite various law enforcement actions and takedown efforts targeting Emotet infrastructure, the malware continues to pose a significant threat to organizations and individuals worldwide. Defending against Emotet and similar malware requires a proactive and multi-layered approach to cybersecurity, including robust email security measures, endpoint protection, network segmentation, user education, and timely security updates.</p>
