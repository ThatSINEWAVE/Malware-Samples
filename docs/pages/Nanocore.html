        <h1>About Nanocore</h1>
        <p>Nanocore is a remote access trojan (RAT) that allows cybercriminals to gain unauthorized access and control over infected computers remotely. It is known for its robust feature set, which includes keylogging, webcam and microphone hijacking, file transfer, and remote desktop functionality.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>How it works?</h2>
        <p>Nanocore typically spreads through phishing emails, malicious downloads, or exploit kits. Once installed on a victim's computer, Nanocore establishes communication with a command-and-control (C2) server operated by the attacker, enabling remote control and data exfiltration.</p>
        <p>Attackers can use Nanocore to execute various malicious actions on infected systems, such as capturing keystrokes, recording audio and video, stealing sensitive information, and executing arbitrary commands. Nanocore operates stealthily to evade detection by antivirus software and security measures.</p>

      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>What is the target?</h2>
        <p>The primary targets of Nanocore are individuals, businesses, and organizations with valuable data or resources. It can infect a wide range of systems, including Windows computers and servers, making it a versatile tool for cybercriminals.</p>
        <p>Nanocore's capabilities make it particularly appealing to cybercriminals seeking to conduct espionage, steal intellectual property, perpetrate financial fraud, or compromise the security of targeted networks. It poses a significant threat to both personal and corporate cybersecurity.</p>

      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>Who created it?</h2>
        <p>The original creator of Nanocore remains unknown, as it is often sold and distributed on underground cybercrime forums. Nanocore may have been developed by individual hackers or organized cybercrime groups looking to profit from illicit activities.</p>
        <p>Over the years, Nanocore has been continually updated and modified by various actors within the cybercriminal ecosystem, leading to the emergence of multiple variants and versions with enhanced capabilities. Its widespread availability on underground markets contributes to its prevalence in cyber attacks.</p>
