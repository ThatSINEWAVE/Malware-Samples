      <h1>About Gafgyt</h1>
      <p>Gafgyt, also known as Bashlite, is a notorious IoT (Internet of Things) botnet malware that primarily targets vulnerable IoT devices. It infects devices such as routers, IP cameras, and DVRs, turning them into bots that can be controlled remotely by the attacker. Gafgyt poses a significant threat to the security and privacy of IoT devices and the networks they are connected to.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>How it works?</h2>
      <p>Gafgyt exploits known vulnerabilities in IoT devices, particularly those with weak or default credentials. It spreads by scanning the internet for devices with exposed ports or services and attempting to brute-force login credentials or exploit known vulnerabilities.</p>
      <p>Once a device is infected, Gafgyt establishes a connection to a command and control (C2) server operated by the attacker. The infected device becomes part of a botnet, allowing the attacker to remotely control it and execute various malicious activities, such as launching DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks, spreading malware, or stealing sensitive information.</p>

      <h2>What is the target?</h2>
      <p>The primary target of Gafgyt is IoT devices, including routers, IP cameras, DVRs, and other internet-connected devices with vulnerabilities. These devices are often targeted due to their widespread adoption, lack of security measures, and susceptibility to exploitation.</p>
      <p>Gafgyt's objective is to recruit as many IoT devices as possible into its botnet, increasing the attacker's control over a large number of devices for malicious purposes. Compromised IoT devices can be used in coordinated attacks, such as DDoS attacks against websites or critical infrastructure.</p>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>Who created it?</h2>
      <p>The creators of Gafgyt remain largely unknown. Like many botnet malware variants, Gafgyt is believed to have been developed by cybercriminals or hacking groups with malicious intent. It is often distributed through underground forums, dark web marketplaces, or via automated scanning and exploitation of vulnerable devices.</p>
      <p>Gafgyt's creators are likely motivated by various factors, including financial gain, political motives, or simply causing disruption and chaos. Defending against Gafgyt and similar IoT botnet malware requires securing IoT devices with strong passwords, regular firmware updates, and network segmentation to isolate vulnerable devices from the rest of the network.</p>
