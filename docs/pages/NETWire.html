      <h1>About NETWire</h1>
      <p>NETWire is a remote access trojan (RAT) designed to provide cybercriminals with unauthorized access and control over infected systems. It is a versatile malware tool commonly used in cyber attacks to steal sensitive information, monitor user activity, and execute malicious commands remotely.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>How it works?</h2>
      <p>NETWire typically spreads through phishing emails containing malicious attachments or links. Once a user interacts with the malicious content and executes the payload, NETWire silently installs and establishes communication with a command-and-control (C2) server operated by the attacker.</p>
      <p>Once connected to the C2 server, NETWire enables the attacker to perform a wide range of malicious activities, including keystroke logging, screen capturing, file transfer, system manipulation, and remote code execution. It operates stealthily to evade detection by antivirus software and security measures.</p>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>What is the target?</h2>
      <p>The primary targets of NETWire are individuals, businesses, organizations, and government agencies with valuable data or resources. It can infect a wide range of systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux computers, making it a versatile tool for cybercriminals.</p>
      <p>NETWire is often used in targeted attacks against specific entities, such as corporations, financial institutions, government agencies, and critical infrastructure sectors. Its capabilities make it particularly appealing to cybercriminals seeking to steal sensitive information, conduct espionage, perpetrate financial fraud, or compromise the security of targeted networks.</p>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>Who created it?</h2>
      <p>The identity of the original creator of NETWire is unknown, as it is often sold and distributed on underground cybercrime forums. NETWire may have been developed by individual hackers or organized cybercrime groups looking to profit from illicit activities.</p>
      <p>Like many other RATs, NETWire has been continually updated and modified by various actors within the cybercriminal ecosystem, leading to the emergence of multiple variants and versions with enhanced capabilities. Its widespread availability on underground markets contributes to its prevalence in cyber attacks.</p>
