      <h1>About LokiBot</h1>
      <p>LokiBot is a notorious banking trojan and information-stealing malware designed to infiltrate systems, steal sensitive information, and conduct financial fraud. It is known for its sophisticated capabilities and wide range of malicious activities, posing a significant threat to cybersecurity.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>How it works?</h2>
      <p>LokiBot typically infects systems through phishing emails, malicious attachments, or exploit kits. Once installed on a victim's computer, it operates stealthily in the background, capturing sensitive information such as login credentials, banking details, and personal data.</p>
      <p>LokiBot is capable of keylogging, form grabbing, and screen capturing to harvest sensitive information entered by users on websites and applications. It then exfiltrates this information to remote servers controlled by cybercriminals, who can exploit it for financial gain or other malicious purposes.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>What is the target?</h2>
      <p>LokiBot primarily targets individuals and organizations in the financial sector, including banks, financial institutions, and their customers. Its victims may include individuals conducting online banking transactions, making purchases, or accessing sensitive financial information.</p>
      <p>However, LokiBot is not limited to the financial sector and may also target users in other industries for personal information, credentials, or other valuable data. Any system or organization that falls victim to LokiBot can suffer severe consequences, including financial losses and reputational damage.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>Who created it?</h2>
      <p>The specific individuals or groups behind LokiBot remain largely unknown, as they typically operate under pseudonyms or aliases to conceal their identities. LokiBot may have originated from underground cybercriminal communities or sophisticated hacker groups with advanced capabilities.</p>
      <p>LokiBot is often distributed through underground forums, dark web marketplaces, or exploit kits, where cybercriminals can purchase or rent access to the malware for their malicious activities. The creators of LokiBot likely have motives rooted in financial gain, exploiting victims' sensitive information for illicit profits.</p>
