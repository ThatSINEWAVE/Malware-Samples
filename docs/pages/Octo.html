      <h1>About Octo</h1>
      <p>Octo is a sophisticated malware strain known for its ability to evade detection and compromise the security of targeted systems. It belongs to the category of advanced persistent threats (APTs) and is designed to conduct espionage, steal sensitive information, and maintain long-term access to compromised networks.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>How it works?</h2>
      <p>Octo employs various techniques to infiltrate and persist within targeted systems. It often spreads through phishing emails containing malicious attachments or links, exploiting vulnerabilities in software or leveraging social engineering tactics to trick users into executing the malware.</p>
      <p>Once inside a system, Octo establishes communication with command-and-control (C2) servers operated by the attackers, allowing them to remotely control the infected devices. It can execute commands, exfiltrate data, download additional payloads, and manipulate system settings to evade detection.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>What is the target?</h2>
      <p>The primary targets of Octo are government agencies, defense contractors, research institutions, multinational corporations, and other high-value organizations with valuable intellectual property, proprietary information, or sensitive data. It is often used in state-sponsored espionage campaigns and cybercriminal activities aimed at financial gain or geopolitical advantage.</p>
      <p>Octo's advanced capabilities and stealthy operation make it a formidable threat to the security and integrity of targeted networks. Its persistence and ability to evade traditional security measures make it challenging to detect and remove once it has infiltrated a system.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>Who created it?</h2>
      <p>The identity of the creators of Octo is often attributed to state-sponsored threat actors or advanced cybercriminal organizations with sophisticated capabilities. The development and deployment of Octo likely involve a team of skilled hackers, researchers, and operatives dedicated to conducting cyber espionage and achieving their objectives.</p>
      <p>Attribution of specific malware strains like Octo to particular groups or nations is often complex and subject to ongoing analysis by cybersecurity researchers and intelligence agencies. However, evidence such as attack patterns, targets, and infrastructure used in campaigns can provide insights into the origin and motives behind Octo's development.</p>
