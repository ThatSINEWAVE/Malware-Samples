        <h2>How it works?</h2>
        <p>NotPetya spreads through various means, including phishing emails containing malicious attachments, compromised websites, or exploiting vulnerabilities in software systems. Once it infects a system, it encrypts files and overwrites the Master Boot Record (MBR), rendering the system inoperable.</p>
        <p>Moreover, NotPetya has worm-like capabilities, enabling it to spread rapidly across networks, infecting other connected systems and amplifying its impact.</p>
