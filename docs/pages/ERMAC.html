      <h1>About ERMAC</h1>
      <p>ERMAC, also known as "Error Macro", is a type of malware that targets Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. It is designed to exploit vulnerabilities in Excel's macro functionality to execute malicious code on infected systems. ERMAC poses a significant threat to organizations using Excel for data processing and analysis.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>How it works?</h2>
      <p>ERMAC spreads through infected Excel files containing malicious macros. When a user opens an infected Excel file and enables macros, ERMAC's malicious code is executed, allowing the malware to infect the system and perform various malicious activities.</p>
      <p>Once installed on a system, ERMAC may perform actions such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or further propagation within the network. It can also download and execute additional malware payloads, leading to further compromise of the infected system.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>What is the target?</h2>
      <p>ERMAC primarily targets organizations and individuals using Microsoft Excel for data processing and analysis. It can infect systems running Microsoft Windows operating systems and Microsoft Office software, particularly Excel versions vulnerable to macro-based attacks.</p>
      <p>Excel files containing sensitive information, such as financial data, business reports, or personal records, are particularly attractive targets for ERMAC. Once infected, these files may be used as vectors for further spreading the malware within the organization or to external parties.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>Who created it?</h2>
      <p>The specific individuals or groups responsible for creating ERMAC are unknown. Like many malware variants, ERMAC may have been developed by cybercriminals or hacking groups with malicious intent. It is part of a broader trend of malware targeting popular software applications to exploit vulnerabilities and compromise systems.</p>
      <p>Defending against ERMAC and similar malware requires implementing security best practices, such as keeping software and security patches up to date, using antivirus and antimalware solutions, and educating users about the risks of opening suspicious files or enabling macros in documents.</p>
