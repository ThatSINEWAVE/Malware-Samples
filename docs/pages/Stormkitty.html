      <h1>About Stormkitty</h1>
      <p>Stormkitty is a type of malware known for its ability to spread rapidly across networks and compromise the security of multiple systems. It poses a significant threat to cybersecurity, often causing widespread damage and disruption to affected networks and organizations.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>How it works?</h2>
      <p>Stormkitty typically spreads through various vectors, including phishing emails, malicious downloads, or exploiting software vulnerabilities. Once it infiltrates a system, it may execute multiple malicious activities, such as stealing sensitive information, encrypting files, or launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.</p>
      <p>Stormkitty may use advanced techniques to evade detection by antivirus software and security measures, including encryption, obfuscation, and polymorphic code. It may also employ self-propagation mechanisms to automatically spread to other vulnerable systems within the same network.</p>
