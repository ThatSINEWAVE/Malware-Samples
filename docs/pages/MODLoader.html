      <h1>About MODLoader</h1>
      <p>MODLoader is a type of malware designed to load and execute malicious modules or payloads on infected systems. It often serves as a dropper or downloader, delivering additional malware components to compromise the targeted system further.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>How it works?</h2>
      <p>MODLoader typically infiltrates a system through various means, such as phishing emails, malicious downloads, or exploitation of software vulnerabilities. Once inside the system, MODLoader executes its primary function of loading and running additional malicious modules or payloads.</p>
      <p>These modules may include ransomware, spyware, banking trojans, or other types of malware designed to steal sensitive information, disrupt system operations, or generate illicit profits for the attackers. MODLoader operates stealthily in the background, making it challenging to detect and remove.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>What is the target?</h2>
      <p>The primary target of MODLoader is often individual users, businesses, or organizations with valuable data or resources. It can infect a wide range of systems, including desktop computers, laptops, servers, and mobile devices, depending on the attacker's objectives.</p>
      <p>MODLoader's versatility allows it to adapt to different attack scenarios and exploit various vulnerabilities in target systems. It poses a significant threat to cybersecurity by facilitating the delivery and execution of additional malware payloads, leading to potential data breaches, financial losses, and system compromises.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>Who created it?</h2>
      <p>The creators of MODLoader, like many other malware authors, often operate anonymously or under pseudonyms to evade law enforcement and cybersecurity investigations. Attribution of specific malware strains to individual actors or groups can be challenging due to the clandestine nature of cybercriminal activities.</p>
      <p>MODLoader may be developed and distributed by independent hackers, criminal syndicates, state-sponsored threat actors, or underground cybercrime forums. Regardless of its origins, MODLoader poses a significant threat to cybersecurity and requires robust defense measures to mitigate its impact.</p>
