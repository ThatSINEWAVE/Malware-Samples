      <h1>About Remcos</h1>
      <p>Remcos is a remote access Trojan (RAT) known for its robust feature set and widespread use by cybercriminals for malicious purposes. Originally marketed as a legitimate remote administration tool, Remcos has since been repurposed by threat actors to gain unauthorized access and control over compromised systems.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>How it works?</h2>
      <p>Remcos typically spreads through phishing emails, malicious downloads, or exploit kits. Once installed on a victim's system, it establishes a stealthy connection to a remote command and control (C&C) server, enabling attackers to execute commands, steal sensitive data, or deploy additional malware.</p>
      <p>Remcos is known for its extensive feature set, including keylogging, screen capturing, file manipulation, and webcam hijacking, providing attackers with comprehensive control over infected systems.</p>

      <h2>What is the target?</h2>
      <p>Remcos targets individuals, businesses, and organizations across various sectors. Its capabilities make it particularly attractive to cybercriminals seeking to steal sensitive information, conduct espionage, deploy ransomware, or launch coordinated cyber attacks.</p>
      <p>Additionally, Remcos has been observed targeting specific industries, including financial services, healthcare, government agencies, and educational institutions.</p>

      <h2>Who created it?</h2>
