      <h1>About QNodeService</h1>
      <p>QNodeService is a malicious tool categorized as a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) designed to provide unauthorized access and control over infected systems. It poses a significant threat to both individuals and organizations by granting remote attackers full control over compromised devices.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>How it works?</h2>
      <p>QNodeService typically infects systems through phishing emails, malicious downloads, or exploiting software vulnerabilities. Once installed on a device, it establishes a covert connection to a remote command and control (C&C) server, allowing attackers to execute commands, steal data, or install additional malware.</p>
      <p>It often employs advanced obfuscation techniques to evade detection by antivirus software and other security measures. QNodeService may also disguise itself as legitimate software or hide within seemingly innocuous files to avoid suspicion.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>What is the target?</h2>
      <p>QNodeService primarily targets both individual users and organizations across various sectors, including government agencies, financial institutions, healthcare organizations, and educational institutions.</p>
      <p>Its capabilities make it particularly dangerous, as attackers can use QNodeService to steal sensitive data, deploy ransomware, or launch coordinated cyber attacks.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>Who created it?</h2>
      <p>The exact origins of QNodeService are often difficult to trace, as it is typically distributed by underground cybercriminal networks or sold on the dark web. It is believed that various threat actor groups, including state-sponsored hackers and financially motivated cybercriminals, are responsible for its creation and distribution.</p>
      <p>QNodeService is continuously updated and adapted by its creators to bypass security measures and exploit new vulnerabilities, highlighting the evolving nature of cyber threats.</p>
