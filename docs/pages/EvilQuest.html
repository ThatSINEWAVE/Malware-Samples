      <h1>About EvilQuest</h1>
      <p>EvilQuest is a macOS-specific ransomware discovered in mid-2020. Unlike typical ransomware, which primarily targets Windows systems, EvilQuest is designed specifically to infect macOS devices. It encrypts files on the infected system and demands a ransom for their decryption, posing a serious threat to macOS users.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>How it works?</h2>
      <p>EvilQuest spreads through various means, including pirated software, malicious email attachments, or compromised websites. Once executed on a macOS system, the ransomware encrypts files using a strong encryption algorithm, making them inaccessible to the user.</p>
      <p>In addition to file encryption, EvilQuest also installs a keylogger and other malicious components on the infected system. These components enable the attackers to steal sensitive information, such as login credentials and financial data, further exacerbating the impact of the attack.</p>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>What is the target?</h2>
      <p>The primary target of EvilQuest is macOS users, particularly individuals and businesses using macOS-based systems. While macOS has historically been considered more secure than Windows, the emergence of threats like EvilQuest highlights the growing sophistication of malware targeting Apple's operating system.</p>
      <p>EvilQuest targets users who may be less vigilant about cybersecurity best practices, such as downloading pirated software or clicking on suspicious links and attachments. It aims to encrypt valuable data on infected systems and extort money from victims through ransom payments.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>Who created it?</h2>
      <p>The identity of the creators of EvilQuest remains unknown. Like many ransomware variants, EvilQuest may have been developed by cybercriminals or hacking groups with malicious intent. The motivation behind EvilQuest is likely financial, as ransomware attacks are often carried out to extort money from victims.</p>
      <p>Defending against EvilQuest and similar macOS-specific threats requires macOS users to implement robust security measures, including keeping software and security patches up to date, avoiding downloading pirated software, exercising caution when opening email attachments or clicking on links, and using reputable antivirus and antimalware software.</p>
