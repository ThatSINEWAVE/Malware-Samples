        <h1>About Sality</h1>
        <p>Sality is a polymorphic virus and worm that primarily targets Windows operating systems. It is known for its ability to infect executable files, spread through removable drives and network shares, and perform various malicious activities, including data theft, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, and remote control of infected systems.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>How it works?</h2>
        <p>Sality infects executable files on Windows systems by appending its code to them. It also creates a copy of itself in the Windows system directory and modifies the system registry to ensure persistence. Once activated, Sality can download and execute additional malware, steal sensitive information, and spread to other connected systems through network shares and removable drives.</p>
        <p>Moreover, Sality employs polymorphic techniques to evade detection by antivirus software, constantly mutating its code to create unique variants that are difficult to identify.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>What is the target?</h2>
        <p>Sality targets Windows-based systems, including individual users, businesses, and organizations. It has been particularly detrimental to the healthcare, financial, and government sectors, where the theft of sensitive data can have severe consequences.</p>
        <p>Additionally, Sality's ability to spread rapidly across networks makes it a significant threat to interconnected systems, including corporate networks and critical infrastructure.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>Who created it?</h2>
        <p>The identity of the creators of Sality remains unknown, as it is often attributed to underground cybercriminal groups. Sality was first discovered in 2003 and has since evolved into various iterations, suggesting the involvement of multiple threat actor groups.</p>
        <p>Given its polymorphic nature and sophisticated propagation techniques, Sality is believed to have been created by experienced malware developers with the intention of causing widespread disruption and financial gain.</p>
