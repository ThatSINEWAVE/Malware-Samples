      <h1>About Glupteba</h1>
      <p>Glupteba is a sophisticated malware strain known for its multifunctional capabilities and stealthy behavior. It belongs to the category of Trojan malware, which means it disguises itself as legitimate software to infiltrate and compromise systems.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>How it works?</h2>
      <p>Glupteba employs a variety of tactics to infect and control target systems. It often spreads through malicious email attachments, fake software updates, or drive-by downloads from compromised websites. Once inside a system, Glupteba establishes a connection with a command and control (C&C) server, allowing remote attackers to execute commands and steal data.</p>
      <p>One of Glupteba's notable features is its ability to update itself and download additional malicious payloads, making it challenging for traditional antivirus software to detect and remove. It can also hijack web browsers, inject malicious code into web pages, and engage in cryptocurrency mining to generate revenue for its operators.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>What is the target?</h2>
      <p>Glupteba targets a wide range of users, including individuals, businesses, and organizations. Its primary objectives include stealing sensitive information such as login credentials, financial data, and personal information. It may also compromise system integrity by installing backdoors, keyloggers, and other malware.</p>
      <p>Moreover, Glupteba has been observed participating in large-scale botnet operations, where infected devices are recruited into a network of compromised systems controlled by cybercriminals. These botnets can be used for various malicious activities, including distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, spam distribution, and further propagation of malware.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>Who created it?</h2>
      <p>The origins of Glupteba can be traced back to underground cybercriminal communities, where skilled hackers and malware developers collaborate to create and distribute malicious software. The identity of the specific individuals or groups behind Glupteba remains elusive, as they operate under aliases and take measures to conceal their identities.</p>
      <p>Glupteba is believed to have evolved over time through continuous development and updates, adapting to changes in cybersecurity defenses and exploiting new vulnerabilities. Its creators may have financial motives, seeking to profit from activities such as data theft, cryptocurrency mining, and the sale of compromised systems on the dark web.</p>
