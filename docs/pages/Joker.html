      <h1>About Joker</h1>
      <p>Joker, also known as Bread, is a type of malware that primarily targets Android devices. It operates by secretly subscribing users to premium services without their consent, resulting in unauthorized charges and financial losses for victims.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>How it works?</h2>
      <p>Joker malware typically infiltrates Android devices through malicious apps available on third-party app stores or disguised as legitimate applications on official app stores. Once installed on a victim's device, Joker remains hidden and initiates subscription processes to premium services in the background without the user's knowledge.</p>
      <p>Joker is known for its sophisticated evasion techniques, often bypassing security measures implemented by app stores to detect and remove malicious apps. It uses dynamic code loading and encryption to conceal its malicious activities, making it challenging for security researchers to detect and mitigate.</p>

      <h2>What is the target?</h2>
      <p>Joker primarily targets Android users, particularly those who download apps from third-party app stores or unofficial sources. Its victims include individuals who inadvertently install malicious apps containing Joker malware, as well as businesses that may face financial losses due to unauthorized premium service subscriptions.</p>
      <p>Users who fall victim to Joker may experience unexpected charges on their mobile phone bills, as the malware subscribes them to premium services without their consent.

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>Who created it?</h2>
      <p>The specific individuals or groups behind Joker malware remain largely unknown, as they operate anonymously to evade law enforcement and security measures. Joker may have originated from underground cybercriminal communities or individual hackers with expertise in mobile malware development.</p>
      <p>Joker is often distributed through underground channels, including forums, websites, and messaging platforms, where cybercriminals exchange malicious apps or sell access to compromised devices. Its creators likely have motives rooted in financial gain, exploiting unsuspecting Android users for illicit profits.</p>
