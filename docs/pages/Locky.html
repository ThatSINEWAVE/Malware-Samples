      <h1>About Locky</h1>
      <p>Locky is a notorious ransomware strain that gained widespread attention for its large-scale attacks on individuals and organizations worldwide. It is known for its sophisticated encryption techniques and widespread distribution methods, posing a significant threat to cybersecurity.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>How it works?</h2>
      <p>Locky typically spreads through phishing emails containing malicious attachments, such as Microsoft Office documents or JavaScript files. When unsuspecting users open these attachments, Locky executes its payload, encrypting files on the victim's computer and network shares using strong encryption algorithms.</p>
      <p>After encrypting files, Locky displays ransom notes with instructions for victims to pay a ransom in cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin or Monero, to receive decryption keys. Locky's encryption is robust, making it extremely challenging to decrypt files without the decryption key, thus forcing victims to consider paying the ransom.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>What is the target?</h2>
      <p>Locky targets a wide range of users and organizations, including individual users, businesses, government agencies, and healthcare institutions. Its victims may vary from individual users with personal files to large enterprises with valuable data and critical systems.</p>
      <p>Locky's indiscriminate targeting and destructive capabilities make it a significant threat in the cybersecurity landscape. Any system or organization that falls victim to Locky can suffer severe consequences, including data loss, financial damage, and operational disruptions.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>Who created it?</h2>
      <p>The specific individuals or groups behind Locky remain largely unknown, as they typically operate under pseudonyms or aliases to conceal their identities. Locky may have originated from underground cybercriminal communities or sophisticated hacker groups with advanced capabilities.</p>
      <p>Ransomware, including Locky, is often distributed through underground forums, dark web marketplaces, or ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) platforms, where cybercriminals can purchase or rent the malware to carry out their attacks. The creators of Locky likely have motives rooted in financial gain, exploiting victims' desperation to recover their encrypted files.</p>
