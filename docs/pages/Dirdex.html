      <h1>About Dirdex</h1>
      <p>Dirdex is a type of malware known for its capabilities in stealing sensitive information from infected systems. It operates stealthily, often evading detection by traditional antivirus software, and can cause significant harm to individuals and organizations.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>How it works?</h2>
      <p>Dirdex typically infects systems through various means, including phishing emails, malicious downloads, or exploit kits. Once installed on a victim's computer, the malware establishes a foothold and begins its malicious activities.</p>
      <p>One of the primary functions of Dirdex is to steal sensitive information such as login credentials, financial data, and personal information. It achieves this by keylogging, screen capturing, and other data exfiltration techniques, sending the stolen information to remote servers controlled by the attackers.</p>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>What is the target?</h2>
      <p>Dirdex targets individuals, businesses, and organizations across various sectors, with a primary focus on entities with valuable data or resources. It is often used in targeted attacks against high-value targets, such as government agencies, financial institutions, critical infrastructure providers, and large enterprises.</p>
      <p>The malware aims to steal sensitive information for various malicious purposes, including identity theft, financial fraud, corporate espionage, and extortion. Its ability to compromise systems and exfiltrate data covertly makes it a significant threat to cybersecurity.</p>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>Who created it?</h2>
      <p>The creators of Dirdex, like many other malware authors, often remain anonymous. Dirdex is believed to have been developed by skilled cybercriminals or groups with malicious intent, possibly operating in underground forums and dark web marketplaces.</p>
      <p>While specific attribution may be challenging, cybersecurity researchers and law enforcement agencies continuously monitor and investigate cyber threats like Dirdex to mitigate their impact and prevent further harm to individuals and organizations.</p>
