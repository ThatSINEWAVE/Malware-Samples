      <h1>About PurpleFox</h1>
      <p>PurpleFox is a sophisticated malware threat known for its multi-stage infection process and its ability to evade detection by traditional antivirus software. Initially discovered in 2018, PurpleFox has since evolved and continues to pose a significant threat to computer systems worldwide.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>How it works?</h2>
      <p>PurpleFox employs a multi-stage infection process to compromise target systems effectively. It typically begins by exploiting vulnerabilities in outdated software, leveraging phishing emails, or utilizing malicious websites to deliver its payload onto victim devices.</p>
      <p>Once executed on a target system, PurpleFox establishes persistence mechanisms to ensure it remains active even after system reboots. It then communicates with command and control (C2) servers operated by cybercriminals to receive further instructions and updates.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>What is the target?</h2>
      <p>The primary targets of PurpleFox are often individuals, businesses, and organizations with vulnerable systems. Like many malware threats, PurpleFox does not discriminate based on specific targets but instead seeks to infect as many devices as possible to maximize its impact and potential for financial gain.</p>
      <p>While PurpleFox primarily targets Windows-based systems, it can potentially infect any device connected to the internet, making it a significant threat to a wide range of users, including home users, small businesses, and large enterprises.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>Who created it?</h2>
      <p>The individuals or groups responsible for creating PurpleFox remain largely unknown. Like many other sophisticated malware threats, PurpleFox is believed to be the work of skilled cybercriminals or organized hacking groups operating in the underground cybercrime ecosystem.</p>
      <p>Attributing the creation of malware like PurpleFox is challenging due to the anonymity and decentralized nature of cybercrime. However, cybersecurity researchers and law enforcement agencies continue to monitor PurpleFox activities and collaborate to identify and disrupt the operations of the threat actors behind it.</p>
