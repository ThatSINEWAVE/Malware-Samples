      <h1>About 888RAT</h1>

      <h2>How it works?</h2>
      <p>888RAT typically spreads through malicious email attachments, phishing campaigns, or compromised software downloads. Once installed on a target system, it operates stealthily in the background, evading detection by security software. The malware establishes a covert connection to a remote command and control (C2) server, enabling the attacker to remotely control the infected system. This control encompasses a wide range of activities, including viewing, modifying, and exfiltrating files, recording keystrokes, capturing screenshots, and even activating the webcam and microphone.</p>
