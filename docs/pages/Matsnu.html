        <h1>About Matsnu</h1>
        <p>Matsnu, also known as Gozi ISFB, is a sophisticated banking trojan and information-stealing malware that has been active since around 2007. It is designed to infiltrate systems, steal sensitive information, and carry out financial fraud, posing a significant threat to cybersecurity.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>How it works?</h2>
        <p>Matsnu typically spreads through various distribution channels, including phishing emails, malicious websites, exploit kits, or drive-by downloads. Once installed on a victim's computer, it operates stealthily in the background, avoiding detection by security software.</p>
        <p>Matsnu is capable of a wide range of malicious activities, including keylogging, form grabbing, web injection attacks, and man-in-the-browser attacks. It targets users' sensitive information, such as login credentials, banking details, and personal data, which it exfiltrates to remote servers controlled by cybercriminals.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>What is the target?</h2>
        <p>Matsnu primarily targets individuals and organizations in the financial sector, including banks, financial institutions, and their customers. Its victims may include individuals conducting online banking transactions, making purchases, or accessing sensitive financial information.</p>
        <p>However, Matsnu is not limited to the financial sector and may also target users in other industries for personal information, credentials, or other valuable data. Any system or organization that falls victim to Matsnu can suffer severe consequences, including financial losses and reputational damage.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>Who created it?</h2>
        <p>The specific individuals or groups behind Matsnu remain largely unknown, as they typically operate under pseudonyms or aliases to conceal their identities. Matsnu may have originated from underground cybercriminal communities or sophisticated hacker groups with advanced capabilities.</p>
        <p>Matsnu is often distributed through underground forums, dark web marketplaces, or exploit kits, where cybercriminals can purchase or rent access to the malware for their malicious activities. The creators of Matsnu likely have motives rooted in financial gain, exploiting victims' sensitive information for illicit profits.</p>
