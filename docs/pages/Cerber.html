        <h1>About Cerber</h1>
        <p>Cerber is a notorious ransomware strain known for its widespread distribution and devastating impact on victims' systems. Since its emergence, Cerber has remained a significant threat in the cybersecurity landscape, causing financial losses and disrupting operations for individuals and organizations.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>How it works?</h2>
        <p>Cerber typically infects systems through phishing emails containing malicious attachments or links. Once executed on a victim's system, the ransomware encrypts files using strong encryption algorithms, rendering them inaccessible to the user. A ransom note is then displayed, demanding payment in cryptocurrency in exchange for the decryption key.</p>
        <p>Cerber employs sophisticated techniques to evade detection by antivirus software and security measures, making it challenging for victims to recover their files without paying the ransom. The malware may also spread to other connected devices or networks, exacerbating the impact of the attack.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>What is the target?</h2>
        <p>Cerber targets individuals, businesses, and organizations across various sectors, with a particular emphasis on entities holding valuable data or assets. It does not discriminate based on geographic location or industry, making anyone with vulnerable systems susceptible to attack.</p>
        <p>The ransomware is often distributed in large-scale spam email campaigns, targeting a wide range of potential victims. However, Cerber may also be used in targeted attacks against specific entities, particularly those with lax security measures or outdated software.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>Who created it?</h2>
        <p>The creators of Cerber remain largely unknown, as they operate anonymously in underground forums and dark web marketplaces. It is believed that Cerber is the work of a skilled cybercriminal group or possibly a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation, where the malware is offered for sale or rent to other cybercriminals.</p>
        <p>Despite various mitigation efforts by cybersecurity researchers and law enforcement agencies, Cerber continues to evolve and adapt, posing a persistent threat to individuals and organizations worldwide. Defending against Cerber and similar ransomware requires a proactive and multi-layered approach to cybersecurity, including regular data backups, endpoint protection, network segmentation, user education, and incident response planning.</p>
