      <h1>About Hook</h1>
      <p>Hook is a type of malware that operates by intercepting system functions and events to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or control over infected systems. It is often used by cybercriminals to carry out various malicious activities, including data theft, espionage, and system manipulation.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>How it works?</h2>
      <p>Hook malware works by injecting malicious code into legitimate system processes or applications, allowing it to intercept and modify system functions and events. By doing so, it can capture sensitive information such as keystrokes, passwords, and credit card numbers entered by users.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Hook malware may exploit vulnerabilities in software or operating systems to gain escalated privileges and execute malicious commands. It can also create backdoors or remote access points, enabling cybercriminals to control infected systems remotely.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>What is the target?</h2>
      <p>Hook malware targets a wide range of users, including individuals, businesses, and organizations. Its primary goal is to steal sensitive information, compromise system integrity, and gain unauthorized access to valuable resources.</p>
      <p>Moreover, Hook malware may be used in targeted attacks against specific industries or sectors, where cybercriminals aim to steal proprietary information, trade secrets, or intellectual property. Its impact can be significant, leading to financial losses, reputational damage, and legal liabilities for victims.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>Who created it?</h2>
      <p>The specific individuals or groups behind Hook malware vary, as it is developed and distributed by cybercriminals with different motives and objectives. Hook malware may be created by individual hackers, organized cybercrime groups, or state-sponsored actors seeking to achieve specific goals.</p>
      <p>Like other types of malware, Hook may be distributed through various channels, including phishing emails, malicious websites, or software downloads. Its creators may have financial motives, seeking to profit from the sale of stolen information or by offering Hook malware as a service to other cybercriminals.</p>
