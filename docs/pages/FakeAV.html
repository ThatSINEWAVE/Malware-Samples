        <h1>About FakeAV / Rogue Antivirus</h1>
        <p>FakeAV, also known as Rogue Antivirus, is a type of malware that deceives users into believing their systems are infected with malicious software. It displays fake alert messages and prompts users to purchase or download a bogus antivirus program, which is often ineffective or even harmful.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>How it works?</h2>
        <p>FakeAV malware typically spreads through drive-by downloads, malicious websites, or disguised as legitimate software. Once executed, it employs various tactics to appear legitimate, such as mimicking the user interface of genuine antivirus products and displaying alarming messages about supposed infections.</p>
        <p>If the user falls for the deception and attempts to purchase or download the fake antivirus program, the malware may steal sensitive information, like credit card details, or further compromise the system by installing additional malicious components.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>What is the target?</h2>
        <p>FakeAV primarily targets individual users and small businesses, exploiting their lack of security awareness and fear of potential threats. It can infect a wide range of Windows operating systems, making it a widespread problem for home and office users.</p>
        <p>While FakeAV is primarily designed to generate revenue for cybercriminals through deceptive sales tactics, it can also be used as a delivery mechanism for other malware payloads or to gain unauthorized access to infected systems.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>Who created it?</h2>
        <p>FakeAV malware is often developed and distributed by organized cybercrime groups seeking to profit from their malicious activities. These groups may operate on a large scale, employing techniques to evade detection and maximize their illicit gains.</p>
        <p>However, due to the widespread availability of FakeAV code and the potential for financial gain, individual cybercriminals may also create and distribute their own variants of this malware.</p>
