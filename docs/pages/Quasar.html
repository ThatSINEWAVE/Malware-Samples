      <h1>About Quasar</h1>
      <p>Quasar is a powerful and versatile Remote Administration Tool (RAT) used by cybercriminals to gain unauthorized access and control over compromised systems. Originally developed for legitimate remote administration purposes, Quasar has since been repurposed by malicious actors to conduct a wide range of cyber attacks.</p>

      <h2>How it works?</h2>
      <p>Quasar is typically spread through phishing emails, malicious downloads, or exploiting software vulnerabilities. Once installed on a victim's system, it establishes a covert connection to a remote command and control (C&C) server, allowing attackers to execute commands, steal sensitive data, or deploy additional malware.</p>
      <p>Quasar is known for its extensive feature set, including keylogging, screen capture, file manipulation, and webcam hijacking, providing attackers with comprehensive control over compromised systems.</p>
