      <h1>About BanLoad</h1>
      <p>BanLoad is a malicious software known for its capability to steal sensitive information from infected systems. It has been a significant threat in the cybersecurity landscape, particularly targeting users in the banking sector.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>How it works?</h2>
      <p>BanLoad typically infects systems through phishing emails, malicious attachments, or exploit kits. Once installed on a victim's computer, the malware stealthily operates in the background, evading detection by security software. Its primary function is to steal sensitive information such as banking credentials, credit card details, and personal data.</p>
      <p>The malware achieves this by logging keystrokes, capturing screenshots, and monitoring web browsing activities. It may also employ techniques to bypass two-factor authentication mechanisms and intercept communication between the victim and banking websites.</p>

      <h2>What is the target?</h2>
      <p>BanLoad primarily targets users in the banking sector, including individual consumers and financial institutions. Its main objective is to steal financial information and credentials, which can then be used for fraudulent activities such as unauthorized transactions, identity theft, and account takeover.</p>
      <p>The malware may also target users in other sectors, depending on the goals of the attackers. However, its prevalence and impact are most pronounced within the banking industry.</p>
    </section>

      <p>Despite efforts by cybersecurity experts and law enforcement agencies to disrupt its operations, BanLoad continues to be a persistent threat to users in the banking sector. Defending against BanLoad and similar malware requires robust cybersecurity measures, including endpoint protection, network monitoring, user education, and timely security updates.</p>
