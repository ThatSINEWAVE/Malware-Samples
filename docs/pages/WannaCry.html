      <h1>About WannaCry</h1>
      <p>WannaCry is a notorious ransomware strain that gained global attention following its widespread outbreak in May 2017. Leveraging a vulnerability in the Windows operating system, WannaCry propagated rapidly across networks, encrypting files and demanding ransom payments from victims in exchange for decryption keys.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>How it works?</h2>
      <p>WannaCry spreads through a worm-like mechanism, exploiting the EternalBlue vulnerability in the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, which is used for file sharing in Windows systems. Once a system is infected, WannaCry encrypts files on the local disk and network shares, rendering them inaccessible to the user.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, WannaCry utilizes a payment infrastructure involving Bitcoin to receive ransom payments from victims. However, there is no guarantee that paying the ransom will result in the recovery of encrypted files.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>What is the target?</h2>
      <p>WannaCry targets primarily Windows-based systems, including personal computers and servers, across various sectors, including healthcare, finance, government, and manufacturing. Its indiscriminate nature and rapid propagation made it one of the most widespread and damaging ransomware attacks in history.</p>
      <p>Moreover, WannaCry's impact extended beyond individual victims, causing significant disruptions to critical infrastructure and economic losses totaling billions of dollars.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>Who created it?</h2>
      <p>The exact identity of WannaCry's creators remains unknown, although various theories and attributions have been proposed by cybersecurity researchers and intelligence agencies. Some speculate that it may have originated from state-sponsored actors, while others suggest involvement from cybercriminal organizations.</p>
      <p>Regardless of its origins, WannaCry served as a wake-up call for the global cybersecurity community, highlighting the importance of timely patching, robust security measures, and effective incident response strategies to mitigate the impact of ransomware attacks.</p>
