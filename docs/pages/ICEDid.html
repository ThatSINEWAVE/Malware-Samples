      <h1>About ICEDid</h1>
      <p>ICEDid is a sophisticated banking Trojan that primarily targets financial institutions and their customers. It is designed to steal sensitive financial information, such as login credentials, credit card numbers, and banking details, from infected systems.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>How it works?</h2>
      <p>ICEDid typically infects systems through phishing emails, exploit kits, or malicious software downloads. Once installed on a victim's computer, it operates stealthily in the background, monitoring the user's online activity and capturing sensitive information entered on banking websites and other online platforms.</p>
      <p>One of ICEDid's notable features is its ability to evade detection by antivirus software and security mechanisms. It achieves this through advanced techniques such as polymorphism, encryption, and code obfuscation, which allow it to continuously mutate and adapt to evade detection.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>What is the target?</h2>
      <p>ICEDid primarily targets individuals and organizations in the financial sector, including banks, financial institutions, and their customers. However, its reach extends beyond the financial industry, as it has been observed targeting users of online payment platforms, e-commerce websites, and other online services.</p>
      <p>By compromising the accounts of unsuspecting users, ICEDid enables cybercriminals to carry out various fraudulent activities, including unauthorized fund transfers, identity theft, and credit card fraud. Its impact can be devastating for both individuals and businesses, leading to financial losses and reputational damage.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>Who created it?</h2>
      <p>The specific individuals or groups behind ICEDid remain unknown, as they operate anonymously within underground cybercriminal communities. ICEDid may be developed and distributed by skilled hackers with advanced knowledge of malware development and cybersecurity.</p>
      <p>ICEDid is often offered as a commodity malware tool on underground forums and marketplaces, where cybercriminals can purchase or rent access to the malware for their malicious activities. The creators of ICEDid likely have financial motives, seeking to profit from the sale of stolen financial data or by offering ICEDid as a service to other cybercriminals.</p>
