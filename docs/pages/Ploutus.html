      <h1>About Ploutus</h1>
      <p>Ploutus is a sophisticated family of malware primarily targeting automated teller machines (ATMs), enabling attackers to perform cash-out attacks and steal large sums of money. First identified in 2013, Ploutus has evolved over time, with variants incorporating new features and evasion techniques.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>How it works?</h2>
      <p>Ploutus infects ATMs through various means, including physical access to the machine or remote compromise of its software systems. Once installed, the malware allows attackers to control the ATM's functions, including dispensing cash without authorization.</p>
      <p>Attackers typically gain access to the ATM's operating system either through physical manipulation of the machine's internals or by exploiting vulnerabilities in the ATM's software remotely. Once inside, they deploy Ploutus, which interfaces with the ATM's control systems to initiate cash-dispensing operations.</p>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>What is the target?</h2>
      <p>The primary target of Ploutus is automated teller machines (ATMs) deployed by banks and financial institutions worldwide. By compromising these machines, attackers can orchestrate cash-out attacks, allowing them to steal significant sums of money in a short period.</p>
      <p>Ploutus attacks pose a severe threat to the financial industry, leading to financial losses for banks and potentially impacting customer trust and confidence in ATM security. As a result, banks and ATM manufacturers continually enhance security measures to mitigate the risk of Ploutus and similar attacks.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>Who created it?</h2>
      <p>The creators of Ploutus remain largely unidentified, as is common with many sophisticated cybercriminal operations. However, the development and distribution of Ploutus are believed to involve skilled individuals or organized cybercrime groups with extensive knowledge of ATM systems and banking infrastructure.</p>
      <p>Attribution of specific individuals or groups behind Ploutus is challenging due to the clandestine nature of cybercrime and the use of tactics to obfuscate their identities. Nonetheless, law enforcement agencies and cybersecurity researchers continue to investigate and monitor Ploutus-related activities to disrupt criminal operations and enhance ATM security.</p>
