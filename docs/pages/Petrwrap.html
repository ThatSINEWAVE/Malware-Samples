        <h1>About Petrwrap</h1>
        <p>Petrwrap, also known as Petya or NotPetya, is a destructive ransomware strain that caused widespread disruption and financial losses to organizations worldwide. It first emerged in 2016 and resurfaced in subsequent attacks, leveraging sophisticated encryption techniques to lock victims out of their systems and demanding ransom payments for decryption.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>How it works?</h2>
        <p>Petrwrap typically spreads via phishing emails containing malicious attachments or links, which, when clicked, execute the ransomware payload. Once inside a system, Petrwrap quickly encrypts files and overwrites the master boot record (MBR) or master file table (MFT) to render the system inoperable.</p>
        <p>Unlike traditional ransomware, Petrwrap has worm-like capabilities, enabling it to move laterally across networks and infect other connected systems. This propagation method contributed to its rapid spread and devastating impact on organizations during large-scale outbreaks.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>What is the target?</h2>
        <p>Petrwrap primarily targets businesses and organizations, including banks, government agencies, healthcare facilities, and critical infrastructure providers. Its sophisticated encryption techniques and destructive capabilities make it particularly dangerous, causing widespread disruption, data loss, and financial harm to affected entities.</p>
        <p>During its notable outbreaks, Petrwrap affected organizations globally, regardless of size or industry, highlighting the indiscriminate nature of its targeting and the importance of robust cybersecurity measures to mitigate its impact.</p>

      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>Who created it?</h2>
        <p>The exact identity of the individuals or groups behind Petrwrap remains unknown. While various theories and attributions have been proposed by cybersecurity researchers and experts, conclusive evidence linking specific actors to the creation and distribution of Petrwrap is lacking.</p>
        <p>Some speculation suggests the involvement of state-sponsored threat actors or cybercriminal organizations with advanced capabilities and motives ranging from financial gain to geopolitical disruption. However, definitive attribution is challenging due to the complex and clandestine nature of cyberattacks.</p>
