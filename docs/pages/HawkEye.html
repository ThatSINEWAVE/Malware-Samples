      <h1>About HawkEye</h1>
      <p>HawkEye is a potent keylogger and information-stealing malware known for its ability to capture keystrokes, log sensitive information, and exfiltrate data from infected systems. It is often used by cybercriminals to conduct targeted attacks aimed at stealing valuable information, such as login credentials, financial data, and personal information.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>How it works?</h2>
      <p>HawkEye typically infects systems through phishing emails, exploit kits, or malicious software downloads. Once installed on a victim's computer, it operates silently in the background, capturing keystrokes, monitoring user activity, and exfiltrating sensitive information to remote servers controlled by cybercriminals.</p>
      <p>One of HawkEye's notable features is its ability to evade detection by antivirus software and security mechanisms. It achieves this through advanced techniques such as polymorphism, encryption, and code obfuscation, which allow it to continuously mutate and adapt to evade detection.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>What is the target?</h2>
      <p>HawkEye primarily targets individuals and organizations with valuable information, including businesses, financial institutions, government agencies, and their customers. Its objective is to steal sensitive information that can be used for various malicious activities, including identity theft, financial fraud, and espionage.</p>
      <p>Moreover, HawkEye may also target individuals for personal gain, such as stealing login credentials for online accounts, email accounts, and social media accounts. Its impact can be devastating for both individuals and organizations, leading to financial losses, reputational damage, and legal liabilities.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>Who created it?</h2>
      <p>The specific individuals or groups behind HawkEye remain unknown, as they operate anonymously within underground cybercriminal communities. HawkEye may be developed and distributed by skilled hackers with advanced knowledge of malware development and cybersecurity.</p>
      <p>HawkEye may be offered as a commodity malware tool on underground forums and marketplaces, where cybercriminals can purchase or rent access to the malware for their malicious activities. Its creators may have financial motives, seeking to profit from the sale of stolen information or by offering HawkEye as a service to other cybercriminals.</p>
