      <h1>About Mamba</h1>
      <p>Mamba is a particularly dangerous strain of ransomware that encrypts entire hard drives instead of individual files. This unique characteristic makes it especially destructive and difficult to recover from, as it locks users out of their entire system.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>How it works?</h2>
      <p>Mamba typically infiltrates systems through phishing emails, malicious attachments, or compromised websites. Once executed on a victim's computer, it encrypts the entire hard drive using strong encryption algorithms, rendering the system inaccessible.</p>
      <p>Unlike traditional ransomware, which encrypts individual files, Mamba encrypts the entire hard disk drive, including the operating system and all user data. This makes it extremely challenging to recover files without the decryption key, which is held for ransom by the attackers.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>What is the target?</h2>
      <p>Mamba targets a wide range of users and organizations, including individual users, businesses, government agencies, and critical infrastructure. Its indiscriminate targeting and destructive capabilities make it a significant threat in the cybersecurity landscape.</p>
      <p>Any system or organization that falls victim to Mamba can suffer severe consequences, including data loss, financial damage, and operational disruptions. Mamba's ability to encrypt entire hard drives makes it particularly devastating, as it can effectively paralyze entire systems.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>Who created it?</h2>
      <p>The specific individuals or groups behind Mamba remain largely unknown, as they typically operate under pseudonyms or aliases to conceal their identities. Mamba may have originated from underground cybercriminal communities or sophisticated hacker groups with advanced capabilities.</p>
      <p>Ransomware, including Mamba, is often distributed through underground forums, dark web marketplaces, or ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) platforms, where cybercriminals can purchase or rent access to the malware for their malicious activities. The creators of Mamba likely have motives rooted in financial gain, exploiting victims' desperation to recover their encrypted files.</p>
