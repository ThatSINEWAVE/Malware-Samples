      <h1>About ZLoader</h1>
      <p>ZLoader is a sophisticated banking Trojan designed to steal sensitive financial information, such as banking credentials, credit card details, and personal identification numbers (PINs). It poses a significant threat to individuals and financial institutions by targeting online banking systems and compromising the security of users' accounts.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>How it works?</h2>
      <p>ZLoader typically spreads through various vectors, including phishing emails, malicious downloads, or exploit kits. Once installed on a victim's device, it operates stealthily to evade detection by security software. ZLoader then monitors the victim's online activities, intercepts sensitive information entered on banking websites, and communicates this data back to the attackers.</p>
      <p>ZLoader may also include features such as keylogging, screen capturing, and web injection, allowing attackers to gather additional information and manipulate the victim's online banking sessions.</p>

      <h2>What is the target?</h2>
      <p>The primary target of ZLoader is individuals and financial institutions, particularly those using online banking services. It aims to steal sensitive financial information, such as login credentials, credit card details, and other personal data, in order to perpetrate financial fraud and theft.</p>
      <p>ZLoader's capabilities make it a significant threat to the security and privacy of online banking users, as well as the reputation and financial stability of financial institutions.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>Who created it?</h2>
      <p>The exact creators of ZLoader remain unknown, as is often the case with malware authors who operate anonymously or under pseudonyms. ZLoader may have been developed by skilled cybercriminals or organized crime groups specializing in financial fraud and cybercrime.</p>
      <p>As ZLoader continues to evolve and adapt to countermeasures, efforts are underway by cybersecurity researchers, financial institutions, and law enforcement agencies to analyze its behavior, develop detection methods, and mitigate its impact on victims.</p>
