        <h1>About Gozi</h1>
        <p>Gozi is a notorious banking Trojan that first emerged in the mid-2000s and has since evolved into various iterations, each more sophisticated than the last. It is designed to steal sensitive financial information, such as login credentials, credit card numbers, and banking details, from infected systems.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>How it works?</h2>
        <p>Gozi typically infects systems through phishing emails, exploit kits, or malicious software downloads. Once installed on a victim's computer, it operates stealthily in the background, monitoring the user's online activity and capturing sensitive information entered on banking websites and other online platforms.</p>
        <p>One of Gozi's key features is its ability to evade detection by antivirus software and security mechanisms. It achieves this through advanced techniques such as polymorphism, encryption, and code obfuscation, which allow it to continuously mutate and adapt to evade detection.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>What is the target?</h2>
        <p>Gozi primarily targets individuals and organizations in the financial sector, including banks, financial institutions, and their customers. However, its reach extends beyond the financial industry, as it has been observed targeting users of online payment platforms, e-commerce websites, and other online services.</p>
        <p>By compromising the accounts of unsuspecting users, Gozi enables cybercriminals to carry out various fraudulent activities, including unauthorized fund transfers, identity theft, and credit card fraud. Its impact can be devastating for both individuals and businesses, leading to financial losses and reputational damage.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>Who created it?</h2>
        <p>The origins of Gozi can be traced back to a group of cybercriminals believed to be based in Eastern Europe. However, the exact identity of the individuals or groups responsible for creating and distributing Gozi remains elusive, as they operate under pseudonyms and employ sophisticated techniques to conceal their identities.</p>
        <p>Over the years, Gozi has undergone multiple iterations and has been distributed through various underground channels, including dark web forums and private cybercrime communities. Its creators may have financial motives, seeking to profit from the sale of stolen financial data or by offering Gozi as a service to other cybercriminals.</p>
