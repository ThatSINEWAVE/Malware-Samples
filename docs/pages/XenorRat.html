      <h1>About XenorRat</h1>
      <p>XenorRat is a dangerous Remote Access Trojan (RAT) designed to infiltrate and compromise computer systems for malicious purposes. Its capabilities include unauthorized remote access, data theft, and system manipulation, making it a significant threat to individuals and organizations.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>How it works?</h2>
      <p>XenorRat typically infects systems through phishing emails, malicious downloads, or exploiting software vulnerabilities. Once installed on a target system, it establishes a covert connection with a remote command and control (C&C) server, allowing attackers to control the compromised system remotely.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, XenorRat may include features such as keylogging, screen capturing, file manipulation, and webcam or microphone spying, enabling attackers to gather sensitive information, steal credentials, and monitor user activities surreptitiously.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>What is the target?</h2>
      <p>XenorRat targets a wide range of individuals and organizations across various sectors, including but not limited to businesses, government agencies, financial institutions, and individual users. Its primary goal is to compromise systems and steal sensitive information, such as personal data, financial credentials, intellectual property, and confidential documents.</p>
      <p>Moreover, XenorRat may be deployed in targeted attacks against specific organizations or individuals for espionage, sabotage, or financial gain.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>Who created it?</h2>
      <p>The identity of XenorRat's creators remains undisclosed, as is often the case with malware authors who operate anonymously or under pseudonyms. XenorRat may have been developed by individual hackers, cybercriminal groups, or state-sponsored actors seeking to exploit vulnerabilities in computer systems for their own malicious purposes.</p>
      <p>As XenorRat poses a significant threat to cybersecurity, efforts are underway by security researchers and law enforcement agencies to analyze its behavior, develop detection methods, and mitigate its impact on affected systems.</p>
