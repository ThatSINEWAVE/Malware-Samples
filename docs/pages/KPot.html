        <h1>About KPot</h1>
        <p>KPot is a type of information-stealing malware designed to harvest sensitive information from infected systems. It is commonly used by cybercriminals to steal credentials, financial data, and other valuable information for various malicious purposes.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>How it works?</h2>
        <p>KPot infects systems through phishing emails, malicious attachments, or exploit kits. Once installed on a victim's computer, it operates stealthily in the background, monitoring user activity and capturing sensitive information entered on websites and applications.</p>
        <p>KPot is capable of keylogging, clipboard monitoring, and taking screenshots to capture sensitive data such as login credentials, credit card numbers, and personal information. It then exfiltrates this information to remote servers controlled by cybercriminals for exploitation.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>What is the target?</h2>
        <p>KPot primarily targets individuals and organizations with valuable information, including businesses, financial institutions, and their customers. Its objective is to steal sensitive information that can be exploited for financial gain, identity theft, or other malicious activities.</p>
        <p>Moreover, KPot may also target individuals for personal gain, such as stealing login credentials for online accounts, email accounts, and social media accounts. Its impact can be significant, leading to financial losses, reputational damage, and legal liabilities for victims.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>Who created it?</h2>
        <p>The specific individuals or groups behind KPot remain unknown, as they typically operate under pseudonyms or aliases to conceal their identities. KPot may have originated from underground cybercriminal communities or individual hackers seeking to profit from stolen information.</p>
        <p>KPot is often distributed through underground forums, dark web marketplaces, or phishing campaigns, where cybercriminals can purchase or rent access to the malware for their malicious activities. The creators of KPot likely have motives rooted in financial gain, exploiting victims' sensitive information for illicit profits.</p>
