      <h1>About AgentTesla</h1>
      <p>AgentTesla is a potent and widely distributed Remote Access Trojan (RAT) known for its espionage capabilities and widespread usage by cybercriminals. First identified in 2014, AgentTesla has since become a prevalent tool in various cybercrime operations, enabling attackers to steal sensitive information from compromised systems.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>How it works?</h2>
      <p>AgentTesla is primarily distributed through phishing emails containing malicious attachments or links. Once executed on a victim's system, the malware stealthily installs itself and begins collecting data. It is equipped with a range of surveillance features, including keylogging, clipboard monitoring, screen capture, and webcam access. AgentTesla exfiltrates the stolen data to a remote command and control (C2) server controlled by the attacker, allowing them to remotely access and control the compromised system.</p>
      <p>AgentTesla's modular design allows attackers to customize its functionality to suit their objectives. It is often used in targeted attacks against individuals, businesses, and organizations, where sensitive information such as login credentials, financial data, and intellectual property is at risk.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>What is the target?</h2>
      <p>AgentTesla primarily targets individuals and organizations across various sectors, including finance, healthcare, manufacturing, and government. Its ability to capture keystrokes and steal sensitive information makes it a valuable tool for cybercriminals engaged in identity theft, financial fraud, corporate espionage, and other malicious activities.</p>
      <p>Attackers deploy AgentTesla in wide-scale phishing campaigns or specifically target high-value individuals and organizations. Once installed on a victim's system, the malware operates silently in the background, evading detection by antivirus solutions and other security measures.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>Who created it?</h2>
      <p>The individuals or group behind AgentTesla remain unknown, operating under pseudonyms or anonymously in underground forums and dark web marketplaces. It is believed that AgentTesla is offered as a malware-as-a-service (MaaS), allowing less technically proficient cybercriminals to deploy it in their operations for a fee. Despite occasional disruptions and takedown efforts by law enforcement and cybersecurity researchers, AgentTesla continues to be actively developed and deployed by threat actors worldwide.</p>
