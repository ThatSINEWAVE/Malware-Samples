      <h1>About GandCrab</h1>
      <p>GandCrab is a high-profile ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation that emerged in early 2018. It quickly gained notoriety for its sophisticated encryption techniques and wide-ranging impact on individuals and organizations worldwide. GandCrab posed a significant threat to cybersecurity, extorting victims for financial gain.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>How it works?</h2>
      <p>GandCrab spreads through various means, including phishing emails, exploit kits, and malicious downloads. Once a system is infected, GandCrab encrypts files using a strong encryption algorithm, rendering them inaccessible to the victim.</p>
      <p>After encrypting the victim's files, GandCrab typically displays a ransom note demanding payment in cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin or Monero, in exchange for a decryption key. The ransom amount often varies based on factors such as the victim's perceived ability to pay and the importance of the encrypted data.</p>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>What is the target?</h2>
      <p>The primary targets of GandCrab are individuals and organizations of all sizes, across various industries and sectors. It indiscriminately encrypts files on infected systems, regardless of the victim's profile or geographic location.</p>
      <p>GandCrab targets Windows-based systems, including desktops, laptops, and servers. It encrypts a wide range of file types, including documents, images, videos, databases, and more, making it particularly devastating for victims who rely on their digital data for personal or professional purposes.</p>

    <section class="article-content box">
      <h2>Who created it?</h2>
      <p>The identity of the individuals or group behind GandCrab remains unknown. The malware was operated as a RaaS model, meaning that affiliate cybercriminals could license the ransomware from its creators and distribute it on their own, sharing a portion of the ransom payments with the GandCrab developers.</p>
      <p>The GandCrab operation was eventually shut down in June 2019 following a coordinated law enforcement operation. However, variants of GandCrab and similar ransomware continue to pose a threat, highlighting the ongoing challenge of ransomware in the cybersecurity landscape.</p>
