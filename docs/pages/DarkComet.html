      <h1>About DarkComet</h1>
      <p>DarkComet is a remote administration tool (RAT) developed by independent programmer Jean-Pierre Lesueur, also known as "DarkCoderSc". Initially intended for legitimate remote administration purposes, DarkComet has gained notoriety for its abuse by malicious actors to gain unauthorized access to systems.</p>

      <h2>How it works?</h2>
      <p>DarkComet is typically distributed through various means, including phishing emails, malicious downloads, or exploit kits. Once installed on a victim's system, the RAT establishes a connection with a remote command and control (C2) server controlled by the attacker, providing them with complete control over the infected system.</p>
      <p>DarkComet offers a wide range of features, including keylogging, remote desktop control, file system manipulation, webcam and microphone monitoring, and more. These capabilities allow attackers to steal sensitive information, monitor user activities, and perform malicious actions without the victim's knowledge.</p>

      <p>The RAT can be deployed for various malicious purposes, including espionage, data theft, financial fraud, and network disruption. Its versatility and stealth capabilities make it a favored tool among cybercriminals seeking unauthorized access to systems and sensitive information.</p>
