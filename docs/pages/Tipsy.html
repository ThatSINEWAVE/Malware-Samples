        <h1>About Tipsy</h1>
        <p>Tipsy is a malicious software program categorized as adware. Unlike other types of malware that focus on stealing data or damaging systems, adware primarily aims to display unwanted advertisements to users, often generating revenue for the creators through pay-per-click schemes.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>How it works?</h2>
        <p>Tipsy infiltrates systems through various methods, including software bundling, deceptive advertising, or malicious downloads. Once installed on a device, it modifies browser settings or installs browser extensions to inject advertisements into web pages visited by the user.</p>
        <p>Tipsy may also collect browsing data, such as search queries and visited websites, to customize the ads displayed to users and maximize click-through rates. In some cases, it may redirect users to malicious websites or engage in other harmful activities.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>What is the target?</h2>
        <p>The primary target of Tipsy is internet users who encounter the adware-infected software or advertisements. Tipsy aims to generate revenue for its creators through pay-per-click schemes, affiliate marketing, or other advertising-related monetization strategies.</p>
        <p>While Tipsy may not directly harm systems or steal sensitive information like other types of malware, its presence can disrupt the user experience, slow down system performance, and compromise online privacy by tracking and collecting user data without consent.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="article-content box">
        <h2>Who created it?</h2>
        <p>The creators of Tipsy, like many adware developers, often operate anonymously or under pseudonyms to avoid detection and legal repercussions. Tipsy may have been developed by individual hackers, adware distributors, or organized cybercriminal groups seeking to profit from online advertising.</p>
        <p>While adware like Tipsy may seem less harmful compared to other types of malware, its proliferation highlights the importance of maintaining vigilance and implementing effective cybersecurity measures to protect against all forms of malicious software.</p>
